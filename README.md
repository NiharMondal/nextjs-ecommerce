## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables defined in .env.example to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use Vercel Environment Variables for this, but a .env file is all that is necessary.

```bash
npm install

npm run dev


```

> Note: You should not commit your .env file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Mongodb database.
